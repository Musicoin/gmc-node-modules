This module is used by the Musicoin Desktop project, and can be included in other projects as well. 

Usage:

1. `yarn add gmc-bin-prebuilts`
2. Binaries will be available at `./node_modules/gmc-bin-prebuilts/bin/`
3. Move the binaries into position or use them from their location. The Musicoin project, at
present, chooses to move the file wanted into place, using this as a devDependency.
